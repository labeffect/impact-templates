The class of data you request determines the sharing mechanism you will use.
                            <br />  <br />
                            IMPACT currently uses five data classes and associated sharing approval mechanisms: Unrestricted (click-through), Quasi-Restricted (click-through), Unrestricted Non-Commercial (click-through), Quasi-Restricted Non-Commercial (click-through) and Restricted (formal written agreement). Any data provided in the Unrestricted, Unrestricted Non-Commercial, Quasi-Restricted, and Quasi-Restricted Non-Commercial categories will not include any restrictions on the use of the data other than on commercial use , as appropriate, and the ability for the Data Provider or ICC to vet Researchers prior to the provision of data to Researchers by a Data Host.
                            <br />  <br />
                            Unrestricted or Unrestricted Non-Commercial data may be used by approved Researchers without the approval of the relevant Data Provider(s) of the requested data.
                            <br />  <br />
                            Quasi-Restricted or Quasi-Restricted Non-Commercial data may only be used by Researchers upon the approval of the relevant Data Provider(s).
                            <br />  <br />
                            Restricted data requires the execution of a written Memorandum of Agreement and approval from the relevant Data Provider(s) and the Application Review Board, and may also require execution of a Data Use Agreement between the Researcher and the Data Provider.
                            <br />  <br />
                            The classes are defined as follows:
                            <ul>

                                <li><b style="font-weight:700!important;">Quasi-Restricted</b>: Data in this class are released upon request after the click-through terms are agreed to by the requester and subject to both the ICCâ€™s ensuring, through its application review process, that the data requested are reasonably consistent with the stated use for the data in the request, and the relevant Data Providersâ€™ approving the request.</li>
                                <br />

                            Request a dataset by completing all the steps required to apply for unrestricted, quasi-restricted or restricted data and submitting your request to the PREDICT Coordinating Center (ICC) for processing.
                            <br /><br />
                            A request starts with a search of our data catalog, where you will select the datasets of interest to you.
                            <br /><br />
                            You may browse our data catalog from the Home page but you must have an account to request data.
                            <br /><br />
                            If the data are classified as unrestricted or unrestricted non-commercial, you must complete the Terms of Use (TOU) click-through agreement to complete your request.
                            <br /><br />
                            If the data are classified as quasi-restricted or quasi-restricted non-commercial, you must complete the TOU but access is delayed until the provider approves.
                            <br /><br />
                            If the data are classified as restricted, you must complete a dataset request form and sign a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and Data Use Agreements (DUA) agreeing to terms of use. The ARB must review and approve your request and the ICC must execute the MOA before you can get access.

                            You may request as many datasets as are necessary to complete your work. However, you may only submit a request for one classification at a time. You may not combine unrestricted, quasi- or restricted data into one request.

                            No. You can request multiple datasets from the same classification on the same form and can even include datasets for different research projects. The explanations for how the datasets will be used can be combined into one entry in the Request Reason text box.
